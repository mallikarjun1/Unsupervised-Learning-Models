# Unsupervised-Learning-Models
# Applied K-Means, Agglomerative and DBSCAN Clustering on each vectorizer.
Applied K-Means on each vectorizer BOW, TF-IDF, AVGW2V, TF-IDF W2V and considered 50,000 reviews only.
The best K found by Elbow Method using inertia.
Plotted the Word Cloud per each cluster.
Applied Agglomerative clustering on AVGW2V and TFIDFW2V vectorizer and considered 5000 reviews only.
Plotted the word cloud for each no.of. Clusters 2 and 5. 
Applied DBSCAN Clustering on AVGW2V and TFIDFW2V Vectrozier and considered 5000 reviews only.
The best epsilon found using Elbow method.
Estimated no.of clusters found only 1 cluster and all the words represented in one cluster and plotted the word cloud.
